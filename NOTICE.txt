SOCIAL CONTRACT

In return for the effort so many people contribute to the DistrictBuilder 
project, we would appreciate it if you would give back to this collective effort
through one of the following ways:

  - If you like the DistrictBuilder project, please use it. Install it at your 
    institution, create a site and encourage others to do the same. Please also 
    cite the DistrictBuilder project in your reports and publications, and 
    spread the word at conferences, meetings and in casual conversation. The 
    broader our user base becomes, the easier it is for all of us to improve the
    software to the benefit of everyone.

  - If you think of a useful new feature that could improve DistrictBuilder, 
    please suggest improvements, send us code to implement them, or sponsor the 
    development of specific features with grants or gifts.

  - If you find a problem, please report the issue so that we can try to fix it 
    (or even better, send us a patch).

  - Commercial profit-making ventures also are welcome to use DistrictBuilder 
    software in any way consistent with our licensing requirements. In some 
    cases our team may be able to provide training and technical assistance in 
    support of your development efforts, when feasible and when we judge that 
    such help improves the general applicability of, or promotes, the overall 
    project. Support for DistrictBuilder via financial contributions, coding 
    assistance, or temporary personnel detailed to our team, make it easier for 
    us to assist your efforts.
