== Amazon EC2 instances ==
    If you want to launch a publicmapping instance from an AMI, you can do so from the 
    AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home)

    1. Find the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you want to use.  Check publicmapping.org to
        get the ID of the latest AMI, or search for "DistrictBuilder".

    2. Right-click on the AMI and click Launch Instance.  You can choose whichever size
        image you'd like.  You must also choose a key pair from those you've created in
        Amazon.  Make sure your firewall rules allow access on ports 80 and 443 (http(s)),
        22 (SSH for administration)

        Allow ports 25 (smtp) and 465 (smtps) for all users of the site if you wish the
        system to receive incoming mail.

        To administer geoserver, you'll need to allow connections on port 8080 for your
        administrators. Port 8081 may also be useful in troubleshooting if BARD reporting
        does not work.

    3. Once the Instance is created and running, you can view it on the Instances window
        in the AWS Console.

    4. You should now be able to connect to your web application at the public DNS address.
       (This is viewable from the EC2 console) 

    5. By default, there is an administrator account on the web app called "Admin" with the
       password "admin".  You should change this through either the publicmapping app (Use the
       "My Account" link in the corner) or through the Django admin application (accessible
       through the URL http://<public DNS>/admin/)


Optional: 

You can connect to your instance and change any of the settings.py configuration values 
from their defaults. 

    1. Right-click on your instance in the console and select "Connect".  You'll be shown
        the command to SSH to your new Instance.  You'll have to have your private key
        for the AWS keypair you chose earlier.
      
        NB: The instances do not use the name "root" for the ssh account to connect with.
        These servers are made from Canonical images and use the account name "ubuntu", e.g.

             ssh -i publicmapping.pem ubuntu@ec2-75-101-251-183.compute-1.amazonaws.com 

    2. To check the public DNS name of your instance,  run the following command on the instance
         
        curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname/
    
    6. Once you've changed your server settings, restart apache with the command:
        
        sudo service apache2 restart

    (Note: using "touch /projects/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder/django/publicmapping.wsgi" should
     also reload the app if changes are limited to the django site )
